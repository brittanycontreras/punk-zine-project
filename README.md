# punk-zine-project

## Overview
This zine was created for an undergradaute UC Berkeley club zine publication called "GAG Magazine", exploring Japanese punk subculture and its social impact. The project combines historical research with editorial design to document how punk music functioned as both cultural rebellion and community formation.

Some archival images are used for editorial context. All layout, writing, and design direction are original.

## My Role
- Co-designer (with Christine)
- Lead layout and composition
- Primary writer and editor
- Responsible for visual storytelling and narrative structure

## Design Approach
- Archival collage aesthetic to reflect punk’s DIY ethos
- Layered textures and asymmetry to mirror underground zine culture
- Integration of historical context (The Blue Hearts, The 5.6.7.8’s)
- QR code integration for interactive extension

## Tools Used
- Canva / Photoshop
- Digital collage composition
- Editorial layout design

## Reflection
If revisiting this project today, I would:
- Replace certain archival images with licensed/public domain equivalents
- Develop an interactive digital zine version
- Expand the research component into a multimedia archive
